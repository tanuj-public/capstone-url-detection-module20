# Malicious URL Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust machine learning solution for detecting and classifying malicious URLs. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of URLs categorized as benign, defacement, phishing, or malware, the aim is to build a predictive model capable of enhancing online security through effective URL identification. The project encompasses the full machine learning pipeline, from data acquisition and exploratory analysis to advanced deep learning model development and rigorous performance evaluation.

## Project Structure

* `capstone-checkout-1-url-detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
* `Dataset/`: This directory is expected to contain the `malicious_phish.csv` dataset.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.7+ and the following libraries installed. It is highly recommended to set up a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud tensorflow scikit-learn colored
````

## Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration

The project begins by loading the `malicious_phish.csv` dataset, which comprises URLs and their corresponding types. Initial data inspection and statistical analysis reveal:

  * **Dataset Size:** The dataset contains a total of **651,191 entries**.
  * **Column Structure:** It includes two main columns: `url` (object type, representing the URL string) and `type` (object type, representing the URL classification).
  * **Missing Values:** Initial checks confirm that there are **no missing values** in either the `url` or `type` columns.
  * **Duplicate URLs:** A total of **641,119 unique URLs** are present, indicating approximately **10,072 duplicate URL entries** (651,191 - 641,119). These duplicates will be addressed during the data cleaning phase.
  * **Target Variable Distribution (`type` column):** Analysis of the URL types reveals a significant class imbalance, which is critical for model evaluation:
      * `benign`: 428,103 entries (approx. 65.7%)
      * `defacement`: 96,457 entries (approx. 14.8%)
      * `phishing`: 70,210 entries (approx. 10.8%)
      * `malware`: 32,149 entries (approx. 4.9%)
      * Other types: Remaining entries, if any, will also be accounted for.
        This imbalance will influence the choice of evaluation metrics, prioritizing precision, recall, and F1-score over simple accuracy.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Effective URL classification heavily relies on transforming raw URL strings into numerical features. This project undertakes comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering steps:

  * **Duplicate Handling:** Duplicate URLs are identified and addressed to ensure each unique URL contributes appropriately to the training process and to prevent data leakage during cross-validation.
  * **Text Preprocessing:** URLs undergo various text processing steps, which may include lowercasing, removal of non-alphanumeric characters, and potentially stemming/lemmatization if relevant for specific features.
  * **Numerical Feature Extraction:** A rich set of numerical features are engineered from each URL. These aim to capture characteristics indicative of malicious intent:
      * **Length-based features:** Total URL length, hostname length, path length, query length.
      * **Character-based features:** Counts of specific 'suspicious' characters (e.g., '@', '-', '\_', '?', '=', '&', '%', '.', '\#'), presence of digits.
      * **Domain-based features:** Number of subdomains, presence of IP address in hostname, TLD (Top-Level Domain) extraction, checks for common URL shorteners or deceptive TLDs.
      * **Lexical features:** Analysis of suspicious keywords, common phishing terms, or brand names using techniques like n-grams or simple word counts within URL segments.
  * **Statistical Analysis of Engineered Features:** Once numerical features are engineered, a detailed statistical analysis will be performed on these new features. This includes calculating mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile ranges for each feature, broken down by URL `type`. This will help understand the typical ranges and distributions of these features for different URL categories, informing model development.
  * **Vectorization for Deep Learning:** For deep learning models, the processed URL strings are tokenized and converted into numerical sequences suitable for embedding layers. This typically involves building a vocabulary from the entire corpus of URLs and mapping each word/character to a unique integer.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations

Visualizations play a key role in understanding the dataset's characteristics and the patterns within the URLs:

  * **Class Distribution:** Bar plots or pie charts effectively illustrate the significant class imbalance in the `type` column, highlighting the challenge for classification and informing the choice of evaluation metrics.
  * **Word Clouds:** A word cloud generated from the URL strings provides a visual summary of the most frequent terms or character sequences, which can give qualitative insights into common patterns in both benign and malicious URLs.
  * **Feature Distribution Plots:** Histograms and box plots are used to visualize the distribution of engineered numerical features (e.g., URL length, number of dots), allowing for comparison across different URL types to identify discriminating characteristics. This will help in understanding if certain features statistically differ between benign and malicious URLs.
  * All visualizations are carefully crafted with clear titles, readable axis labels, and appropriate scaling to ensure legibility and effective communication of insights.

## Model Development and Evaluation

The URL detection task is framed as a **multi-class classification problem**.

  * **Model Selection:** Deep learning models, specifically built using **TensorFlow and Keras**, are chosen for their ability to learn complex patterns from sequential data like URLs. These models are particularly effective when combined with embedding layers to represent tokenized URLs.
  * **Baseline Model:** A baseline machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or a simpler tree-based classifier) is established to provide a fundamental performance benchmark against which the optimized deep learning model's efficacy can be measured.
  * **Evaluation Metrics:** The models are rigorously evaluated using a suite of classification metrics, providing a comprehensive view of performance:
      * **Accuracy:** Overall proportion of correct predictions. While useful, it is interpreted cautiously due to class imbalance.
      * **Precision:** The proportion of correctly predicted malicious URLs out of all URLs predicted as malicious. High precision is crucial to minimize false positives, which could block legitimate websites.
      * **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted malicious URLs out of all actual malicious URLs. High recall is critical to minimize false negatives, ensuring that as many malicious threats as possible are detected.
      * **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric that is particularly valuable for imbalanced datasets.
  * **Interpretation of Results:** The notebook provides detailed interpretation of these metrics for both training and testing sets, explaining the model's strengths and weaknesses in identifying different URL types. Rationale for selecting these specific metrics is provided, emphasizing their importance in a security-critical application where the cost of false positives and false negatives differs.

## Code Quality and Best Practices

High standards for code quality and syntax are maintained throughout the notebook:

  * **Clean Imports:** All necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook with standard aliases.
  * **Error-Free Execution:** All code cells are designed to execute without errors, ensuring a smooth and reproducible analysis workflow.
  * **Sensible Variable Naming:** Variables are named clearly and intuitively (e.g., `df`, `url_features`, `tokenizer`), enhancing code readability.
  * **Appropriate Commenting:** Code is well-commented to explain complex logic, design choices, and non-obvious steps, making the notebook easy to follow and understand.
  * **Concise Output:** Output from code cells is managed to be concise and informative, avoiding verbose displays that could hinder readability.
